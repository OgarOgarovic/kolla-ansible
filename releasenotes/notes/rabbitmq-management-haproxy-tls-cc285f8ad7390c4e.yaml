    Implements TLS encryption between RabbitMQ management and HAProxy
    New setting ``rabbitmq_enable_tls_backend`` (tied by default to
    ``kolla_enable_tls_backend``) enables TLS encryption of backend
    communication between RabbitMQ management plugin (UI and API) and
    HAProxy.

  - |
    When backend TLS encryption is enabled, the RabbitMQ management plugin
    uses different port (15671 instead of 15672) for communication,
    following the convention for RabbitMQ.
