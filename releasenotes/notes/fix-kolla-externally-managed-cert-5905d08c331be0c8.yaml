features:
  - |
    This change adds ``kolla_externally_managed_backend_cert`` flag managing
    the same behaviour as ``kolla_externally_managed_cert`` but for backend
    certificates. If set to ``true`` backend certificates won't be copied from
    operator to hosts, assuming that they are provided externally directly on
    hosts.
upgrade:
  - |
    Update TLS documentation chapter to specify that
    ``kolla_externally_managed_cert`` applies to internal/external certificates
    and ``kolla_externally_managed_backend_cert`` does the same for backend
    certificates.
